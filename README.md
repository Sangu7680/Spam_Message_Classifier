# Spam_Messagae_Classifier

This Spam Message Classifier uses machine learning to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages. It analyzes the text of the message using NLP techniques and classifies it accordingly.

It enhances cognitive insights by:

Identifying spam patterns through text analysis.
Protecting users from unwanted or malicious messages.
Learning from data patterns to improve accuracy over time.
Providing an intuitive UI for instant message classification.

# __Technologies Used__:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
Streamlit (for the interactive web UI)
TfidfVectorizer (for feature extraction from text)
Multinomial Naive Bayes (for classification)
